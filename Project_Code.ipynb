The adjusted R-squared value of 0.531 indicates that the model accounts for over 53% of the variability in daily productivity after adjusting for the number of predictors. The F-statistic for the model was significant, F(6, 37) = 9.120, p < 0.001, indicating that the model as a whole was statistically significant.\n",

        "The provided correlation matrix shows the pairwise correlations between different variables in your dataset. Here's a summary of key findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Highlights:\n",
        "- **Strong Positive Correlations**:\n",
        "  - **Daily Productivity and Productivity Consistency**: There is a moderate to strong positive correlation (r = 0.574), indicating that as daily productivity increases, productivity consistency tends to increase as well.\n",
        "  - **Energy Fluctuations and Productivity Consistency**: A strong positive correlation (r = 0.674) suggests that higher energy fluctuations are associated with greater productivity consistency.\n",
        "  - **Energy Fluctuations and Daily Productivity**: A moderate correlation (r = 0.543) indicates that higher energy fluctuations are related to higher daily productivity.\n",
        "  - **Work/Study Hours and Daily Productivity**: A positive correlation (r = 0.529) suggests that more work/study hours are associated with higher daily productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Moderate to Weak Correlations**:\n",
        "  - **Exercise Frequency and Productivity Consistency**: A moderate positive correlation (r = 0.361) indicates a relationship between exercise frequency and productivity consistency.\n",
        "  - **Consistent Sleep and Daily Productivity**: A positive correlation (r = 0.375) implies that consistent sleep is associated with higher daily productivity.\n",
        "  - **Consistent Sleep and Productivity Consistency**: A positive correlation (r = 0.311) shows a relationship between consistent sleep and productivity consistency.\n",
        "  - **Age and Work/Study Hours**: A positive correlation (r = 0.401) indicates that older participants may tend to have more work/study hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Weak or Non-Significant Correlations**:\n",
        "  - **Age and Daily Productivity**: A very weak positive correlation (r = 0.096) suggests little to no association between age and daily productivity.\n",
        "  - **Sleep Hours and Productivity Variables**: Sleep hours generally show weak or negative correlations with daily productivity and productivity consistency, with the strongest being r = -0.436 for daily productivity.\n",
        "  - **Exercise Frequency and Other Variables**: The correlation between exercise frequency and most other variables is relatively low, with the highest being r = 0.361 with consistent sleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation:\n",
        "- Variables like **energy fluctuations** have significant relationships with both daily productivity and productivity consistency, indicating that maintaining stable energy levels might be beneficial for consistent productivity.\n",
        "- **Daily productivity** and **productivity consistency** show a moderate to strong relationship, which highlights the importance of maintaining a steady output.\n",
        "- **Sleep hours** appear to have a negative correlation with productivity measures, suggesting that more sleep might not always correlate positively with higher productivity or consistency.\n",
        "- **Exercise frequency** shows a weaker relationship overall with productivity measures but still holds some connection to consistent sleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "This correlation matrix helps inform further analysis, such as regression or more complex modeling, to explore causal relationships and predict outcomes based on these variables."

        "- **Productivity Consistency**:\n",
        "  - None of the tested variables (caffeine or exercise frequency) significantly impact productivity consistency. This suggests that while daily productivity can be influenced by caffeine and exercise, these factors do not seem to consistently affect productivity over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusions**\n",
        "- If you are aiming to improve **daily productivity**, focusing on **evening caffeine consumption** and maintaining an **exercise routine** are key factors.\n",
        "- For **productivity consistency**, other variables not tested here might play a more substantial role, as no significant impacts were found in this analysis."

        "  - None of the interaction terms between caffeine and exercise showed significant effects on daily productivity (all p-values > 0.05). For instance, the interaction between caffeine intake in the afternoon and exercise in the afternoon (F = 1.78, p = 0.192) was not significant.\n",

Other types of caffeine (e.g., evening, late-night, morning, and never) did not significantly affect productivity consistency (p > 0.05).\n",

        "- **Caffeine** appears to play a more prominent role in impacting **daily productivity**, particularly in the evening, while the effect on **productivity consistency** is not strong or significant.\n",
        "- **Exercise** did not show significant effects on either **daily productivity** or **productivity consistency**.\n",

        "The analysis suggests that while **evening caffeine intake** has a significant effect on **daily productivity**, the impact of **exercise** on both productivity metrics is not statistically significant. The combination of caffeine and exercise does not have a noteworthy interactive effect on productivity outcomes."

Similarly, variables such as early morning, evening, and morning exercise did not show significant associations with daily productivity or productivity consistency (p-values ranging from 0.1251 to 0.8861). Caffeine consumption at times other than afternoon also did not show significant associations with productivity measures (p-values from 0.1034 to 0.8089).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interpretation**: The significant associations suggest that specific factors like exercise frequency and afternoon caffeine consumption may influence productivity measures and should be taken into account in related studies or productivity interventions. Non-significant results indicate that other factors, such as general caffeine consumption or exercise at different times, may not be as impactful or may require further exploration with larger sample sizes or additional methods."

        "1. **Regression Analysis**: The OLS regression for daily productivity showed a significant model (R² = 0.597, p < 0.001), indicating that factors like work/study hours and sleep hours significantly impact productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Regression Results for Productivity Consistency**: The OLS regression for productivity consistency had an R² of 0.541 (p < 0.001), highlighting energy fluctuations as a significant positive predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Chi-Square Analysis**: Chi-square tests revealed significant associations between exercise frequency and daily productivity (p = 0.0149), suggesting that higher exercise frequency correlates with increased productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Chi-Square Test for Caffeine Consumption**: The test for caffeine consumption and daily productivity was non-significant (p = 0.4962), implying no strong association between caffeine consumption and daily productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Energy Fluctuations**: The analysis indicated that energy fluctuations were positively correlated with both daily productivity (r = 0.543) and productivity consistency (r = 0.674), suggesting their critical role in productivity outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Sleep Variables**: Sleep hours showed a negative correlation with daily productivity (r = -0.436), highlighting the potential impact of sleep quality on productivity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Exercise Frequency**: While exercise frequency correlated positively with productivity consistency (r = 0.361), it did not emerge as a significant predictor in regression models for daily productivity or productivity consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Age Factor**: Age demonstrated weak correlations with productivity variables, indicating that age might have a minimal direct influence on productivity and consistency (r < 0.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Consistent Sleep**: The consistency of sleep was associated with higher daily productivity (r = 0.375) and productivity consistency (r = 0.311), suggesting its importance in sustaining productivity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Significant Predictors**: Work/study hours and energy fluctuations were identified as significant predictors in both regression models, emphasizing the importance of managing work hours and energy for enhancing productivity and consistency."
